## Data
[electricity_clean.xlsx](https://github.com/robynfsj/cfg-big-data-challenge/blob/master/data/electricity_clean.xlsx) – Cleaned electricity data from the various tables provided by the UK government (BEIS, 2020). Certain data have been extracted from the different tables. A contents page provides details of what has been extracted, the source table and futher details. Data are mixed in timescale and span. They are mainly quarterly and monthly timescales and mainly span from either 1995 or 1997 to June 2020.

[response_indicies.xlsx](https://github.com/robynfsj/cfg-big-data-challenge/blob/master/data/response_indices.xlsx) – Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) data showing the measures put in place by governments in response to COVID-19 (Hale et al. 2020). Only UK data has been extracted. There is one worksheet contained data for all of the UK nations combined as well as separate worksheets for the individual UK nations. Data span 2020-01-01 to 2020-08-23.

[demand.csv](https://github.com/robynfsj/cfg-big-data-challenge/blob/master/data/demand.csv) – Rolling demand data (Elexon, 2020). This provides the current electricity demand in the UK at 5 minute intervals for the period 2020-01-01 to 2020-08-30.

[avg_demand_wk.csv](https://github.com/robynfsj/cfg-big-data-challenge/blob/master/data/avg_demand_wk.csv) – Rolling demand data (Elexon, 2020) averaged (mean) for each week.

[avg_demand_d.csv](https://github.com/robynfsj/cfg-big-data-challenge/blob/master/data/avg_demand_d.csv) – Rolling demand data (Elexon, 2020) averaged (mean) for each day.
